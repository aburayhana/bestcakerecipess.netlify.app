recipeingredient:
- "1 Tin Black Beans drained and rinsed"
- "100 ml Rapeseed Oil"
- "80 g Vegetable Margarine"
- "2 tbsp Golden Syrup"
- "1 tbsp Treacle"
- "100 g  50g good quality Chocolate callets min 68 or use a good quality brand chocolate such as Lindt or Suchard"
- "80 g Cocoa powder"
- "220 g Golden Caster sugar"
- "125 g Self raising flour"
- "1/4 tsp Baking powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place oven rack in a low-middle position in the oven.  Heat oven to 180"
- "Line an 8” square tin with baking parchment."
- "Whiz the Black Beans and the vegetable margarine in a food processor until very smooth. Gradually add the oil, while continually processing."
- "Add the Syrup and Treacle, give a quick whizz to blend. The beans should have become fully amalgamated.  Add the melted chocolate to the bean mix, whiz again and turn out into a bowl.  Sift the flour, cocoa and baking powder together into a separate bowl and stir in the caster sugar."
- "Fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture and then beat well.   The consistency should be a reluctant drop. Loosen with a touch more oil if needed.   Stir in most of the remaining 50g chocolate callets, reserving a few to sprinkle on the top.  Pour into the lined tin and spread into the corners."
- "Drag lines across the top in a close zig-zag. Sprinkle with the remaining chocolate callets."
- "Bake for 20 mins and then check the Brownie. Tip to one side to see if it moves slightly and also check to see if a cocktail stick stays clean when inserted.  It is likely it will need a further 5 mins. It should be soft but barely cooked in the middle.  Leave in the tin to cool completely. Cut once cooled. Serve with berries, Vegan ice-cream or a toffee sauce."
