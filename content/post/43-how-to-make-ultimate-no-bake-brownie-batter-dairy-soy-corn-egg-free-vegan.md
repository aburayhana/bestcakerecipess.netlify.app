recipeingredient:
- "3 (15.5 oz) cans black beans"
- "3/4-1 cup Honey local and raw depending on your taste"
- "  or substitute"
- "1 1/2 cups Raw Sugar for the honey"
- "1/2 cup coconut oil or butter"
- "1/2 cup Coco I used dark"
- "1 tsp sea salt"
- "3 teaspoons vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "First you will need either a powerful blender or a food processor to make this recipe."
- "Rinse and strain all the beans, put them in the processor and pulse them briefly."
- "Put a portion of the chosen sweetener in the processor with the beans and blend. It will still be chunky. Add the rest of the sweetener and blend. ••(In the picture I was adding more honey at the end because it wasn&#39;t sweet enough. It is dark from the coco already being added.)••"
- "The batter is still probably chunky at this point."
- "Take half of the coconut oil or butter and add it to the processor. Blend"
- "Add the coco powder, sea salt, vanilla and blend."
- "The batter should be smooth at this point add the last of the oil/ butter."
- "If you add all of the oil at the beginning of the blending process there&#39;s a chance that the beans will never break down all the way and you could have small chunks in your batter. It wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world but I really dislike having chunks in my batter."
- "At the end of the process the text rule resemble that of chocolate pudding."
- "You can eat the batter just the way it is or I like to mix in chocolate chips. I chose to use the chunks this time."
- "You need to put it either in the refrigerator or if you&#39;re impatient like me in the freezer for the oil to cool and to set up. Once it does it will have a closer texture to a traditional brownie batter."
